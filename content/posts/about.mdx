### Shadowing a Component

#### Components

To shadow a component or edit the components from this theme you copy the component into your site with this folder structure:

```
./src/THEMENAME/components
```

However this theme Prebuilds a name-spaced folder in your source folder for you. All you have to do is paste in the components into the prebuild name-spaced components folder. All maker all paths reference other compents change from

```JS
import Navigation from './Navigation'
```

to

```JS
import { Navigation } from '@joshkennedy00/gatsby-theme-blog-remix'
```

once the component is copied over you can delete, add, and edit till you are blue in the face.

#### Templates

The Gatsby Blog **_Remix_** theme only creates the components folder automatically. If you would like to shadow the post template and posts template you will have add the templates folder to the @joshkennedy00/gatsby-theme-blog-remix folder.

## Customizing the Style

## Portals

Blog Remix's mobile navigation makes use of react portals. They are fun ways to have modals, mobile navigations, and overlays. Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component without having to do any redux or global store nonesense. See react's [portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html), or just use the component included in this theme.
